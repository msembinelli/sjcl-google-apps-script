# sjcl-google-apps-script
Small implementation of the Stanford Javascript Crypto Library for Google Apps Script. Adapted/Updated for 2017 GAS from Bruce Mcpherson's implementation http://excelramblings.blogspot.ca/2013/11/encryptiondecryption-library-for-google.html.

# How To Use
Unfortunately the only way to currently use this is to just copy the files into your script. I have plans to make a GAS Library out of this eventually and will be posting the library ID.
